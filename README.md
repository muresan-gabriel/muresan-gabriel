### ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Gabriel.

I'm a frontend developer and a computer science student.

I aim to create fantastic and flawless web experiences.

### About me

I'm passionate about the web and I'm always trying my best to create the greatest experience for the end-user. 

Besides programming, I'm passionate about graphic design. I've been freelancing as a graphic designer for more than two years.

### Personal Projects

* [Personal Portfolio](https://github.com/muresan-gabriel/muresan-gabriel.github.io) - Personal website used to showcase my work, both in development and graphic design.
* [dev.lib](https://devlibproject.netlify.app/) - Platform of open-source assets for developers and graphic designers.
* [orgnz.](https://github.com/muresan-gabriel/digital-organizer) - Online platform which allows you to easily organize your tasks and duties, your economy or your schedule.
* [La moarÄƒ](https://github.com/muresan-gabriel/la-moara-cognizant-softvision) - The project was created to submit homeworks throughout the course's sessions. The idea is to build a fullstack application of a childhood game called 'Nine Men's Morris' or 'La moarÄƒ / Èšintar'.
* [Learning Blog](#) - MERN Stack Application (currently unhosted, waiting for AWS services to activate) created after following a fullstack development course on LinkedIn Learning. This application will eventually be used to write certain details, such as achivements and struggles I've encountered on my way to learn more about web development.
