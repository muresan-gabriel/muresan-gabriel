### ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Gabriel.

I'm a Software Engineer @ Computacenter and a Computer Science student @ the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca.

I aim to create fantastic and flawless web experiences and learn more about web systems' architecture.

### About me

I spent countless hours on graphic design, before focusing on development, which brough a huge advantage to me, as a developer, when building UIs for web applications.

I am continously researching and trying to learn more about the web, trying to follow best practices, studying various topics, from OOP, design patters, software architectural patterns, networking, and much more.

I am experienced with building REST APIs using Node.js and express.js and I have a solid understanding of HTTP methods, requests, responses and overall, Client-Server communication.

I am familiar with React and AngularJS and I am able to create web applications with interactive, dynamic, and good-looking UIs.
Besides JS frameworks and libraries, I am also familiar with CSS frameworks and preprocessors, such as Bootstrap, TailwindCSS, and SCSS, LESS, respectively.
